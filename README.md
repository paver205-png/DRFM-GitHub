Diamond Resonant Field Model: A dynamical systems approach to semantic representation with emergent emotional polarization
# Diamond Resonant Field Model (DRFM)

## Overview

The Diamond Resonant Field Model (DRFM) is a dynamical systems approach to semantic representation. Unlike static embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or attention-based models (Transformers), DRFM models meaning as emergent structure arising from resonant interactions between compositional semantic patterns. Each pattern consists of:

- Semantic primitives  
- Emotional valence (E ∈ [−1,1])  
- Directional vector in semantic space (D ∈ S^{m−1})  

The model demonstrates convergence to stable attractors, spontaneous formation of emotional clusters, and interpretable dynamics of semantic fields.  

## Key Features

- **Resonant Dynamics:** Meaning emerges through interaction of compositional patterns.  
- **Explicit Emotional Axis:** Emotional valence drives cluster formation.  
- **Interpretability:** Each pattern decomposes into primitives, emotion, and direction.  
- **Scalability:** Validated for n = 10–100 patterns with multi-polar structures.  
- **Energy-Based Convergence:** Lyapunov analysis guarantees stability and exponential decay.
